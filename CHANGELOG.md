# 0.26.1
## What's Changed
#### Editorconfig with duplicated sections was freezing IDE's [#989](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/989)
CSharpier was unable to parse an `.editorconfig` file that contained duplicate sections and would crash. This would result in a hung IDE.
```
[*]
insert_final_newline = true

[*]
spelling_languages = en-us
```

Thanks go to @echoix for helping track this down.

#### A .csharpierrc file anywhere above a file now takes priority over any .editorconfig [#987](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/987)
Given the following setup
```
/src/.editorconfig
/src/ProjectName/.editorconfig
/src/.csharpierrc
```

Originally with 0.26.0, the `/src/ProjectName/.editorconfig` file would be used for determining the configuration options for a file within `src/ProjectName`. This resulted in the existing options within `.csharpierrc` being ignored.

With 0.26.1, if a `.csharpierrc` exists anywhere above a given file, it will be used to determine the configuration options.

Thanks go to @parched for reporting the issue.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/belav/csharpier/compare/0.26.0...0.26.1
# 0.26.0
## What's Changed
#### EditorConfig Support
CSharpier will now read configuration options from an `.editorconfig`. See https://csharpier.com/docs/Configuration for more details.

#### Net8 Support
CSharpier now supports the .net8 sdk. It still supports net6 and net7.

#### Sorting of using directives [#661](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/661)
CSharpier now sorts using statements. It follows the following rules
```c#
global using System.Linq; // sort global first
using System; // sort anything in System
using NonSystem; // sort anything non-system
using static Static; // sort static
using Alias = Z; // sort alias
using SomeAlias = A;
#if DEBUG // finally any usings in #if's
using Z; // contents are not sorted as of now
using A;
#endif
```
#### Remove line before the content of a bracketless if/else statement [#979](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/979)
```c#
// input
if (true)

    CallMethod();
else if (false)

    CallMethod();
else

    CallMethod();

for (; ; )

    CallMethod();

while (true)

    CallMethod();

// 0.26.0
if (true)
    CallMethod();
else if (false)
    CallMethod();
else
    CallMethod();

for (; ; )
    CallMethod();

while (true)
    CallMethod();
```

CSharpier now supports primary constructors on structs
```c#
public struct NamedItem2(
    string name1,
    string name2
)
{
    public string Name1 => name1;
    public string Name2 => name1;
}
```
#### Support C# 12 collection expressions [#964](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/964

#### MSBuild - when a file fails to compile csharpier interferes with getting you clickable links to the compilation errors. [#957](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/957)
Build errors will now display properly when using CSharpier.MSBuild
#### Format element access properly in long invocation chains [#956](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/956)
```c#
// 0.25.0
var x = someLongNameField.CallMethod____________________________________().AccessArray[
    1
].Property_______________;

// 0.26.0
var x = someLongNameField
    .CallMethod____________________________________()
    .AccessArray[1]
    .Property_______________;
```
#### Improvements to visible whitespace in console output. [#953](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/953)
When using `cshapier --check` whitespace is now only visible in the following situations

When an otherwise empty line contains whitespace
```
----------------------------- Expected: Around Line 4 -----------------------------
    private string field1;

    private string field2;
----------------------------- Actual: Around Line 4 -----------------------------
    private string field1;
····
    private string field2;
```

When a line has extra trailing whitespace
```
----------------------------- Expected: Around Line 3 -----------------------------
{
    private string field1;
}
----------------------------- Actual: Around Line 3 -----------------------------
{
    private string field1;····
}
```
#### MSBuild is not encoding using UTF8 [#947](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/947)
When CSharpier.MSBuild ran into a failed csharpier check, it was not encoding the std-error output with UTF8. This resulted in messages such as
```
----------------------------- Expected: Around Line 3 -----------------------------
{
┬╖┬╖┬╖┬╖private┬╖string┬╖field1;
}
----------------------------- Actual: Around Line 3 -----------------------------
{
┬╖┬╖┬╖┬╖private┬╖string┬╖field1;┬╖┬╖┬╖┬╖
}

#### Allow line endings to be configurable [#935](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/935)
CSharpier now supports the following options for line endings. The default is `auto`
- "auto" - Maintain existing line endings (mixed values within one file are normalised by looking at what's used after the first line)
- "lf" – Line Feed only (\n), common on Linux and macOS as well as inside git repos
- "crlf" - Carriage Return + Line Feed characters (\r\n), common on Windows

Thanks go to @phuhl for the feature request
#### Avoid breaking only around binary expression but not binary expression itself [#924](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/924)
```c#
// 0.25.0
if (
    someLongStatement == true || someOtherStatement________________________________ == false
)

    item.DoSomething();
```
Thanks go to @Rudomitori for the contribution
**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/belav/csharpier/compare/0.25.0...0.26.0
# 0.25.0
## Breaking Changes
#### Improve if directive formatting [#404](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/404)
The `preprocessorSymbolSets` configuration option is no longer supported. 
CSharpier can now parse and format the full range of `#if` preprocessor statements so it is no longer required.
```
// 0.24.2 - supported some basic versions of #if
#if DEBUG
// some code 
#endif

// 0.25.0 - supports the full range of #if including nested statements
// would require the use of the preprocessorSymbolSets configuration option previously 
#if (DEBUG && !NET48) || MONO
// some code
#if NET6_0
// some other code
#endif 
#endif
```

## What's Changed
#### Sort Modifiers [#725](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/725)
CSharpier will now sort modifiers according to the defaults for [IDE0036](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0036#csharp_preferred_modifier_order)
```c#
// input
public override async Task Method1() { } 
async public override Task Method2() { }

// output
public override async Task Method1() { } 
public override async Task Method2() { }
```

Thanks go to @glmnet for the contribution

#### Support c# 12 features [#883](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/883)
CSharpier now supports formatting 
[Primary Constructors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-12#primary-constructors),
[Alias any typ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-12#alias-any-type), and
[Default lambda parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-12#default-lambda-parameters)

#### Support for log levels [#875](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/875)
CSharpier now supports `--loglevel` with the CLI and `CSharpier_LogLevel` for MSBuild. This changes the level of logging output. Valid options are:
- None
- Error
- Warning
- Information (default)
- Debug

Thanks go to @samtrion for the suggestion

#### CSharpier removes blank line before unsafe block [#917](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/917)
CSharpier was not honoring lines that appeared before `unsafe`
```c#
// input
var x = 1;

unsafe
{
    // should retain empty line
}

// 0.24.2
var x = 1;
unsafe
{
    // should retain empty line
}

// 0.25.0
var x = 1;

unsafe
{
    // should retain empty line
}
```

Thanks go to @fgimian for reporting the bug

#### Adding ability to bypass CSharpier when using CSharpier.MsBuild [#914](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/914)
In some instances it is desirable to completely bypass CSharpier.MsBuild, this can now be done with the `CSharpier_Bypass` property.
```bash
dotnet publish -c release -o /app --no-restore /p:CSharpier_Bypass=true
```

Thanks go to @OneCyrus for the suggestion

#### Strong Name Sign Assemblies [#911](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/911)
CSharpier is now strong name signed so that it can be used in packages that are strong name signed.

Thanks go to @TwentyFourMinutes for the suggestions and to @goelhardik for strong name signing [Ignore](https://github.com/goelhardik/ignore)

#### Don't format files in obj folders [#910](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/pull/910)
CSharpier will no longer format `cs` files that are in an `obj` folder.

#### CSharpier.MsBuild runs once for each framework, can it be more efficient. [#900](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/900)
When CSharpier.MsBuild was in a csproj that had multiple target frameworks, it would run once for each target framework. It will now run just a single time. 

#### CSharpier.MsBuild returns exit code 1 when ManagePackageVersionsCentrally is set to true [#898](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/898)
CSharpier.MsBuild was not running correctly when used in a project that had centrally managed package version.

Thanks go to @adc-cjewett for reporting the bug

#### Multiline comments always indented with spaces when formatting with tabs [#891](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/891)
With `useTabs: true`, CSharpier was formatting multiline comments with a space instead of a tab.
```c#
// input
public class Foo
{
	/**
	 * comment
	 */
	public class Bar { }
}

// 0.24.1
public class Foo
{
 /**
  * comment
  */
	public class Bar { }
}

// 0.25.0
public class Foo
{
	/**
	 * comment
	 */
	public class Bar { }
}
```

Thanks go to @MonstraG for reporting the bug.

#### File scoped namespaces should be followed by a blank line [#861](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/861)
CSharpier now adds an empty line after file scoped namespaces if there is not already one
```c#
// input
namespace Namespace;
using System;

// 0.25.0
namespace Namespace;

using System;
```

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/belav/csharpier/compare/0.24.2...0.25.0
# 0.24.2
## What's Changed
#### csharpier-ignore comments force CRLF line endings [#884](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/884)
In a case where 
- a file on windows (which defaults to CRLF) contained only LF
- the file contained `// csharpier-ignore` on a multi-line statement
- the file was formatted in multiple passes due to preprocessor symbols (such as an `#if DEBUG`)

CSharpier would end up formatting the file with `CRLF` on the `// csharpier-ignore` statement but `LF` in the rest of the file. The file would then fail the formatting check.

Thanks go to @pingzing for the bug report and detailed reproduction steps.

#### Support scoped variables (better handling of unrecognized syntax nodes) [#839](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/839)
Scoped variables are a language proposal. CSharpier has some support for printing unrecognized syntax nodes but the validation logic didn't account for them and would throw an exception
```c#
scoped Span<byte> span;
```
Thanks go to @Dragemil for reporting the bug
#### Unrecognized syntax nodes lose comments [#869](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/869)
CSharpier now supports printing commends on unrecognized nodes.
```c#
// comment on unrecognized node
scoped Span<byte> span;
```

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/belav/csharpier/compare/0.23.0...0.24.0


# 0.23.0
## Breaking Changes
#### Make compile errors public when using CSharpier.Core [#799](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/799)
Previously `CodeFormatter.Format(unformattedCode)` and its overloads returned only the formatted code. It now returns a result object.
```c#
public class CodeFormatterResult
{
    public string Code { get; }
    public IEnumerable<Diagnostic> CompilationErrors { get; }
}
```

This is a breaking change. There were also a number of types that should not have been `public` that were made `internal`.

Thanks go to @verdverm for the suggestion
## What's Changed
#### Allow comment-description suffix on csharpier-ignore comments [#835](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/835)
It is now possible to include a suffix on `csharpier-ignore` comments. The description must be seperated from the comment by at least one - character.
```c#
// csharpier-ignore - class copied as-is from another project
public class Unformatted     { 
        private string     unformatted;
}

// csharpier-ignore-start -- class copied as-is from another project

#### Allow passing --config-path to cli [#777](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/777)
It is now possible to pass `--config-path` to the cli for cases where it is not in the root or you want to bypass the auto location and speed up formatting requests.
```bash
dotnet csharpier . --config-path "./config/.csharpierrc"
```

Thanks go to @bdovaz for the suggestion

#### Allow blank lines in query syntax [#754](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/754)
It is now possible to add blank lines in query syntax expressions which can aid in readability
```c#
var result = await (
    from post in dbContext.Posts
    join blog in dbContext.Blogs on post.BlogId equals blog.Id
    
    let count = dbContext.Posts.Count(p => p.Name == post.Name)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/belav/csharpier/compare/0.22.0...0.23.0

# 0.22.1
## What's Changed
#### Fix for CSharpier.MsBuild so it selects a compatible framework if the project does not target net6 or net7 [#797](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/pull/797)
This fix auto selects `net7.0` for projects that do not target `net6.0` or `net7.0`. This means the `CSharpier_FrameworkVersion` property is only required if a project is targeting < `net6.0` and `net7.0` is not installed.

Thanks go to @samtrion for submitting the fix.

# 0.22.0
## Breaking Changes
#### Support only UTF8 and UTF8-BOM files [#787](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/pull/787)
Previously UTF.Unknown was used to try to determine file encodings. 
This was problematic because if a file was too small it would not properly detect the encoding.
```c#
public enum MeetingLocation
{
  Café,
  Restaurant
}
```
This file saved as UTF8 would be detected as SBCSCodePageEncoding and result in CSharpier trying to parse the following file
```c#
public enum MeetingLocation
{
  CafÄ‚Â©,
  Restaurant
}
```

CSharpier now only supports UTF8 & UTF8-BOM files. This is consistent with the IDE plugins, which stream files to CSharpier as UTF8.

Thanks go to @Meligy for reporting the problem.

#### CSharpier.MSBuild support for .NET 7 [#773](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/773)
CSharpier.MSBuild now multi-targets net6.0 and net7.0. As a side effect of multi-targeting, the `CSharpier_FrameworkVersion` property is now required for projects that do not target `net6.0` or `net7.0`. See https://csharpier.com/docs/MsBuild#target-frameworks

Thanks go to @OneCyrus for reporting it

## What's Changed
#### Fix for CSharpier.MsBuild "Specified condition "$(CSharpier_Check)" evaluates to "" instead of a boolean" [#788](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/pull/788)
When projects referencing CSharpier.MsBuild were reloaded, they would get the error "Specified condition "$(CSharpier_Check)" evaluates to "" instead of a boolean" and fail to load.


Thanks go to @samtrion for submitting the fix.

#### List Pattern support for subpattern within a slice [#779](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/779)

CSharpier did not have proper support for the new c# 11 slice pattern. When a slice contained a pattern, that pattern would be lost.

```c#
// input
var someValue = someString is [var firstCharacter, .. var rest];

// 0.21.0
var someValue = someString is [var firstCharacter, ..];

// 0.22.0
var someValue = someString is [var firstCharacter, .. var rest];
```

Thanks go to @domn1995 for reporting it

#### Fix for comments within expressions in interpolated strings [#774](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/774)
When an interpolated string contained a comment within an expression, CSharpier was inserting a line break that resulted in invalid code.

```c#
// input
var trailingComment = $"{someValue /* Comment shouldn't cause new line */}";

// 0.21.0
var trailingComment = $"{someValue /* Comment shouldn't cause new line */
    }";

// 0.22.0
var trailingComment = $"{someValue /* Comment shouldn't cause new line */}";
```

Thanks go to @IT-CASADO for reporting it

#### Always put generic type constraints onto a new line [#527](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/527)
```c#
// 0.21.0
public class SimpleGeneric<T> where T : new() { }

// 0.22.0 
public class SimpleGeneric<T>
    where T : new() { }
```
#### Always put constructor initializers on their own line [#526](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/526)
```c#
// 0.21.0
public Initializers() : this(true) { }

public Initializers(string value) : base(value) { }

// 0.22.0
public Initializers()
    : this(true) { }

public Initializers(string value)
    : base(value) { }
```

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/belav/csharpier/compare/0.21.0...0.22.0


# 0.21.0
## What's Changed
#### Support file scoped types [#748](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/748)
CSharpier now supports a file scoped type
```c#
file class FileScopedClass
{
    // implementation
}
```

#### Csharpier removes empty lines in ignored blocks of code [#742](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/742)
In some instances csharpier was removing empty lines in `csharpier-ignore` blocks of code
```c#
// input
public class KeepLines1
{
    // csharpier-ignore-start
    private string    first;

    private string    second;
    // csharpier-ignore-end
}

// 0.20.0
public class KeepLines1
{
    // csharpier-ignore-start
    private string    first;private string    second;
    // csharpier-ignore-end
}
```

Thanks go to @MonstraG for reporting it

#### Await + LINQ query syntax indents incorrectly [#740](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/740)
```c#
// 0.20.0
var result = await from thing in Things
from otherThing in OtherThings
from finalThing in SomethingAsync(thing, otherThing)
select finalThing;

// 0.21.0
var result = await
    from thing in Things
    from otherThing in OtherThings
    from finalThing in SomethingAsync(thing, otherThing)
    select finalThing;
```
Thanks go to @domn1995 for reporting it.

#### Break anonymous object creation when there are more than two properties [#753](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/753)
Object initializers break when they have more than two properties. For example
```c#
var x = new Thing
{
    Post = post,
    Blog = blog,
    SamePostNameCount = count
};
```

Anonymous object initializers were not included in this logic prior to 0.21.0
```c#
// 0.20.0
var result =
    from post in Posts
    select new { Post = post, Blog = blog, SamePostNameCount = count };

// 0.21.0
var result =
    from post in Posts
    select new
    {
        Post = post,
        Blog = blog,
        SamePostNameCount = count
    };
```

Thanks go to @TwentyFourMinutes for reporting it.

#### Support net7 [#756](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/pull/756)
The CSharpier dotnet tool now works with net6 or net7.

#### Fix for ignoring subfolders in node_modules [#762](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/pull/762)
CSharpier was not properly ignoring .cs files when they were in a subfolder of node_modules

Thanks go to @snebjorn for reporting the bug.

# 0.20.0
## What's Changed
#### Improve Tuple formatting [#735](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/#735)
Tuples would break poorly in some cases
```c#
// 0.19.2

public async Task<(ILookup<string, int> someLookup, ILookup<int, string> reverseLookup, ILookup<
        string,
        ClassName
    > thirdLookup)> CreateLookups()
{
    return (null, null);
}

public void TuplesAsInput(
    (int myInt, string myString, ClassName myClassNameInstance, Dictionary<
        int,
        string
    > wordList) inputArgs
)
{
    // do something
}

// 0.20.0
public async Task<(
    ILookup<string, int> someLookup,
    ILookup<int, string> reverseLookup,
    ILookup<string, ClassName> thirdLookup
)> CreateLookups()
{
  return (null, null);
}

public void TuplesAsInput(
    (
        int myInt,
        string myString,
        ClassName myClassNameInstance,
        Dictionary<int, string> wordList
    ) inputArgs
 )

# 0.19.1
## What's Changed
#### CSharpier crashes when run multiple times simultaneously [#728](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/728)

The new caching for CSharpier didn't properly handle multiple CSharpier processes formatting at the same time. This is most common when using CSharpier.MsBuild in a solution with multiple projects.

Thanks go to @pingzing for reporting the bug.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/belav/csharpier/compare/0.19.0...0.19.1


# 0.19.0
## What's Changed
#### Adding a cache to speed up formatting. [#692](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/692)
CSharpier now caches information about files that it has formatted to speed up subsequent runs.  
By default the following are used as cache keys and a file is only formatted if one of them has changed.

- CSharpier Version
- CSharpier Options
- Content of the file

The cache is stored at [LocalApplicationData]/CSharpier/.formattingCache.

#### Ignore node_modules [#699](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/699)

CSharpier now ignores any files within a node_modules folder.

Thanks go to @RichiCoder1 for the suggestion and @SubjectAlpha for the implementation.

```c#
// 0.18.0
public class ClassName
{
    public int[] SomeArray { get; set; } =  { 1, 2, 3 };
}
// 0.19.0
public class MyClass
{
    public int[] SomeArray { get; set; } = { 1, 2, 3 };
}

```
