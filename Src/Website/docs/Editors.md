Running CSharpier on save is recommended. It will speed up your development time. All of the official extensions support it.

**Note** It is important to use CSharpier as a [local dotnet tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools#install-a-local-tool) to ensure files are formatted consistently across team members and environments.
