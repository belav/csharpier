# CSharpier Formatter for Visual Studio Code

[CSharpier](https://github.com/belav/csharpier) is an opinionated code formatter for c#.
It uses Roslyn to parse your code and re-prints it using its own rules.
The printing process was ported from [prettier](https://prettier.io) but has evolved over time.

## Installation

Install through VS Code extensions. Search for `CSharpier`

Can also be installed in VS Code: Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.

## Limitations
This extension currently only works with a globally installed version of csharpier. See [this issue](https://github.com/belav/csharpier/issues/493) for details.
