# csharpier-rider

<!-- Plugin description -->
[CSharpier](https://github.com/belav/csharpier) is an opinionated code formatter for c#. 
It uses Roslyn to parse your code and re-prints it using its own rules. 
The printing process was ported from [prettier](https://prettier.io/) but has evolved over time.
